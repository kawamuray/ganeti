{-| Executing jobs as processes

The protocol works as follows (MP = master process, FP = forked process):

* MP sets its own livelock as the livelock of the job to be executed.

* FP creates its own lock file and sends its name to the MP.

* MP updates the lock file name in the job file and confirms the FP it can
  start.

* FP calls 'executeFile' and replaces the process with a Python process

* FP sends an empty message to the MP to signal it's ready to receive
  the necessary information.

* MP sends the FP its job ID.

* FP sends an empty message to the MP again.

* MP sends the FP its live lock file name (since it was known only to the
  Haskell process, but not the Python process).

* Both MP and FP close the communication channel.
