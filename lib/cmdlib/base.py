    completed). This way locking, hooks, logging, etc. can work correctly.

    LUs which implement this method must also populate the self.needed_locks
    member, as a dict with lock levels as keys, and a list of needed lock names
    as values. Rules:

      - use an empty dict if you don't need any lock
      - if you don't need any lock at a particular level omit that
        level (note that in this case C{DeclareLocks} won't be called
        at all for that level)
      - if you need locks at a level, but you can't calculate it in
        this function, initialise that level with an empty list and do
        further processing in L{LogicalUnit.DeclareLocks} (see that
        function's docstring)
      - don't put anything for the BGL level
      - if you want all locks at a level use L{locking.ALL_SET} as a value

    If you need to share locks (rather than acquire them exclusively) at one
    level you can modify self.share_locks, setting a true value (usually 1) for
    that level. By default locks are not shared.

    This function can also define a list of tasklets, which then will be
    executed in order instead of the usual LU-level CheckPrereq and Exec
    functions, if those are not defined by the LU.
